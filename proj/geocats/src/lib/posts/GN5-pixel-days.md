## **Arts & Culture**

#### Around the world

*Connecting the dots and compiling the Georing.* 

This was a project was a big one for Geocats. At 1800 pixels wide this world map is a massive undertaking. It contains deserts, jungles, mountain ranges, fjords, oceans, beaches, tundra, islands, wetlands... Everything we could think of.
For now though, we feel like this map gives Geocats more than enough space to tell the stories that we've been writing over the last years. This map marks a big point in the project, and we're very excited to explore this creation in greater detail over the next months.

*Editors note: This map makes up only 1/3rd the total area of the inner Georing.*

#### Diamond in the Rough

The waterfalls are also complete. Filled to the brim with eroded metamorphic rocks complete with exposed gemstones! Players can look forward to exploring this ecosystem in the coming update.
This was a massive project, but well worth the effort. The team at NONACO can't wait to share it with everyone in it's entirity soon.

## **Research & Development**

### Qix Mono, Fun to Play with Easy to Read

Nonaco has been very grateful to be working with an incredible designer to create a custom typeface for our game and many others. This typeface is designed to be as easy to read as possible. It's inspired by some of our favourite arcade games, and we think it turned out very well. 
The website for Qix-Mono is finished and ready to be shared with the world. You can try it out for yourself on their [website](https://qix-mono.info/)!

"[qix mono] originated from the idea of designing a custom typeface for the video game Geocats. As a 2D pixel-art platformer, Geocats is a stylistic tribute to Arcade Games from the 1980s and 1990s. What sets Geocats apart is its integration of cutting-edge technologies and the teams' proximitiy to the player community. The game offers players an exciting geocaching experience that leads through the multi-layered worlds of GeoTerra while holding rewarding surprises for cat lovers.

The team behind Geocats has a strong philosophy of openness and inclusivity, and is constantly looking for simple yet accessible design solutions to reach the diverse gaming community. In order to invite players to explore the worlds, an easy-to-grasp dialog system that encourages further reading is key. Realising this vision, resulted in the redesign of the dialog boxes and the implementation of [qix mono]. The dialog system thus aims to communicate the games' story in an engaging way without overwhelming the players with text."

### NONACO "Delicious Bites" recall!

For those that haven't heard, NONACO "Delicious Bites" are full of plastic chunks of varying size. Still, they're pretty tasty, and I'd totally recommend them to anyone who likes crunchy snacks.
