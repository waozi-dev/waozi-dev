## **Important News**

![A chill place to hang](/geonews/tower.png)

### Introduction

Welcome to edition 4 of Geonews. We're busy making assets and adding scripts, Vulcan is working with us to get services back up and running, and our community is cooler than ever. 
Wishing you all a pleasant start to the year. 

### GEOCATS:V2.5 - ***Incredibly** Extended* Cold Snap

- ...Thank you for waiting. There's an icy prize waiting for fans of Geocats. It's waiting at the end of this newsletter.

### GEOCATS:V420 - Super Complimentary Edition

- Vulcan and Nonaco agree that the best way to succeed is to succeed with friends. Coperation and patience is key to both of us. As Vulcan sets up their infrastructure, we're happily building our game in anticipation for their new blockchain.
- In the interest of entertainment while we patiently wait, we are releasing Geocats Complimentary edition for everyone to try out. A demo that is open for anyone to play! 
- This version will not have any interaction with blockchain and primarily exists to showcase what we've been working on. No date as to when we'll release this, but it won't be long and we'll make sure to give a heads up.

## **Arts & Culture**

#### **Here's a quick look at our GeoQuarium and the new overworld map that we're creating.**

We consulted with an expert catstronaut currently working on  the Geoquariums. This video was filmed to showcase a bit of what our cosmos contains. Here's what Catstronaut #9 had to share... a look at our interstellar backyard!

## **Research & Development**

![Sunset](/geonews/desert_sky.png)

### Chrysoberyl and it's effects on 0xoplasmosis, preliminary tests are promising!

Cat's Eye crystals are a type of Aluminum Oxide which exibit a rare optical trait known as *chatoyancy*. Chatoyancy is a certain effect seen in gemstones which is caused by light reflecting perpendicular to the mineral's fibres. The result is a rare crystal that looks similar to the unique eye of a feline. 
When light is concentrated through this crystal, it takes on a special property that is seen to disable 0xoplasmosis infection in lab enviroment tests. Whether this leads to any useful developments in curing the afflicted cats remains to be seen. 

As of this year, NONACO has significantly cut funding to it's science department stating "What we don't know can't hurt us."

I've been intentionally putting bugs and errors into the NONACO codebase. That way, I'll always have a job with this backwards company.
