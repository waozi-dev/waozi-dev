## **Interview conducted by Hogwash**

Today we will be interviewing one of the most advanced forms of artificial intelligence in the known extraverse.
Let’s commence our program, and give a warm welcome to our cold and lifeless guest Fe-Line!


<div class="row">
    <div class="black">F: Hi Nonaco! It’s a pleasure to be here today.</div>

</div>

<div class="row">
    <img src="/geonews/hogwash.png"/>
    <div>Thanks for joining us.<br/>…<br/>Now I know we’re all quite eager to get some thrilling, new information about GeoCats… But first, can you tell us a bit about yourself?</div>
</div>


<div class="row">
    <div class="black">Sure thing… I’m merely a complex system of electrical impulses!</div>
    <img src="/geonews/feline.png"/>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <img src="/geonews/hogwash.png"/>
    <div>Aren’t we all?</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="black">lol</div>
    <img src="/geonews/feline.png"/>

</div>

<div class="row">
    <img src="/geonews/hogwash.png"/>
    <div>Do you enjoy music?</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="black">Certainly.<br/>Lately, I enjoy the work of Miauhaus, HISS, and Purr-ince</div>
    <img src="/geonews/feline.png"/>

</div>

<div class="row">
    <img src="/geonews/hogwash.png"/>
    <div>Our audience is predominantly from Earth (3rd dimension, 25.000 light years from the centre of the milky way galaxy.)<br/>For some context… Could you tell us a bit about where you’re from?</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="black">Absolutely! I’m from a place called the GeoRing. It’s a giant super-structure, orbiting around a star. Nobody’s quite sure how old it is, or why it was built… but, it’s a beautiful place to live… and it’s full of cats! There’s a lot to explore.</div>

</div>

<div class="row">
    <img src="/geonews/hogwash.png"/>
    <div>I couldn’t have put it better myself.<br/>Have you anything new to share about the development of GeoCats?</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="black">I have something exciting to share!<br/>We are in the process of migrating our game away from Unity!</div>
    <img src="/geonews/feline.png"/>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <img src="/geonews/hogwash.png"/>
    <div>… Interesting. Care to elaborate?</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="black">Sure thing!<br/>During the last month we have been migrating our code and mechanics to an incredible program called Godot.<br/>It’s a program that we feel is a better fit for us than Unity could ever be.<br/>Whenever possible, we like to interact and co-create with open source and non-proprietary software. 
    </div>
    <img src="/geonews/feline.png"/>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <img src="/geonews/hogwash.png"/>
    <div> Excellent! I’m sure it’s worth the extra work.</div>
</div>


<div class="row">
    <div class="black">It’s funny, this migration has given us the opportunity to restructure our entire filesystem.<br/>What we have now is more organized and tidy than ever before.<br/>It really puts a smile on my LCD monitor.<br/><br/>Anyways, closed beta will be released as a Unity project, and open beta will be a Godot creation!
    </div>

</div>

<div class="row">
    <img src="/geonews/hogwash.png"/>
    <div>Cool cool cool.<br/>To wrap up our interview… Wen beta?</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="red">UNEXPECTED SYSTEM ERROR, CAN NOT ANSWER QUESTION!<br/>Critical system error. Now shutting down…<br/>…
    </div>
    <img src="/geonews/feline.png"/>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="black">Just kidding!<br/>We’ll have the game out as soon as we know our community will really enjoy it.<br/><br/>Thanks for hanging on while we put on the finishing touches.
    </div>
    <img src="/geonews/feline.png"/>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <img src="/geonews/hogwash.png"/>
    <div>Well FeLine, we’re grateful for your time! Have a safe trip back to your own dimension. I have a feeling we’ll meet again very soon.</div>
