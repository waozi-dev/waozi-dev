# Pixelflux

Pixelflux is a unique project that allows users to claim ownership over pixel layers. If you own the topmost layer of a pixel, you can customize its color. While your ownership of a layer is permanent, others can purchase a new layer on top of yours. When this happens, the payment for the new layer is distributed among all existing layer owners of that pixel. Each time a layer is added, the pixel's value increases by its base price. It's possible to buy several layers at once. Select one of the cards below to start playing!
