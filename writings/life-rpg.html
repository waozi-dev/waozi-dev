            <h1>Life RPG</h1>
<p>Growing up stuck in the matrix, getting sucked into technology. Losing the true path as we become alienated and detached from the real world.</p>
<p>Like many of us, I am no stranger to these experiences.</p>
<hr>
<p>I find it vital to understand that we can modify our brains, change how we think and act. We are not taught these things. So we must find out for ourselves.</p>
<p>One of such techniques I have found useful in periods of my life, especially during difficult times. Is to &quot;gamify&quot; my life. So far I have successfully utilized the game 3 times in my life.</p>
<ul>
<li>While living rural in Portugal</li>
<li>During the plandemic in Germany</li>
<li>And while traveling in ASEAN.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game is simple, and I have used physical paper and pen to make this game playable.</p>
<p>I design a token, for example my waozi token.</p>
<p>I sign each and every token I &quot;print&quot;, by scribling on a piece of paper and cutting it up into little squares I add to my &quot;bank&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/life-rpg/cutting_tokens.jpg" alt="Cutting up my waozi tokens"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>cutting up my woazi tokens</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, my bank is a simple plastic shot glass.</p>
<p>I then design quests I can do to gain these tokens.</p>
<p>I usually come up with a few dailies. Such as swim in the cold lake. Do the wim hof breathing technique and do 10 push ups.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/life-rpg/stopwatch.jpg" alt="stopwatch showing how long i stayed in the water"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would usually swim between 5-10 min in the icey lake shown in the cover photo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After finishing a quest I would receive a fair amount of tokens. I add the tokens to my wallet manually and then I can enjoy my own little shop.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/life-rpg/pipe_shop.jpg" alt="A pipe displayed in the shop"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stainless steel pipe to smoke hash or weed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of these items I would indulge myself with my tokens is smoking my pipe. With this strategy I managed to keep building my routine and keep my consumption balanced.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The beauty about this game is that you can make it as simple or as complex as you want. And constantly calibrate with your current possibilities.</p>
<div class='image-row'><img src="../assets/life-rpg/lifebox_above.jpg" alt="My life Box"><img src="../assets/life-rpg/lifebox_front.jpg" alt=""></div>
<blockquote>
<p>My &quot;life&quot; box, each day separated into a new section in a box</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the plandemic, I ended up extending the LIFE RPG game into an entire Life Box, where i would split each day into separate chakras and focus on the energy of that day. The game is meant to be fun.</p>
<p>Once you learn to make routines in your life, you know you can do it and you can start again even when you stop for a longer period.</p>
<p>The hardest is to get into a routine in the first place. There are many strategies to get into a routine, and you should experiment and find out what works best for you.</p>
